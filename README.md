HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR BODY MASS INDEX OR BMI

BMI is your weight (in kilograms) over your height squared (in centimeters). Let’s calculate, however, using pounds and inches.

For instance, the BMI of a person who is 5’3" and weighs 125 lbs is calculated as follows:

Multiply the weight in pounds by 0.45 (the metric conversion factor)
125 X 0.45 = 56.25 kg


2. Multiply the height in inches by 0.025 (the metric conversion factor)
63 X 0.025 = 1.575 m


3. Square the answer from step 2
1.575 X 1.575 = 2.480625


4.Divide the answer from step 1 by the answer from step 3
56.25 : 2.480625 = 22.7


The BMI for a person who is 5’3" and weighs 125 lbs is 22.7 or practically, 23.


A healthy BMI ranges between 19 and 25.
